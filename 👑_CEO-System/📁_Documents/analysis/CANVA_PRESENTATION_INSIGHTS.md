  // מה שהראית בסרטון על פרופילים "ריקים"
  research: {
    step1: "Company research → Team page",
    step2: "Recent news → Current projects",
    step3: "LinkedIn activity → Interests",
    step4: "Mutual connections → Warm intro"
  },
  
  messageAngle: {
    // דוגמאות מהסרטון
    "Found your company blog about [TOPIC]",

    "Your CEO mentioned needing [SKILL] talent"
  }
};
```

  }
};
```

## 7. LLM Integration Strategy

### Smart Agent Collaboration:
```javascript
const llmStrategy = {
  gpt4: {
    use: "Complex analysis, personality inference",
    example: "Analyze GitHub code style → personality"
  },
  
  gpt35: {
    use: "Template filling, basic matching",
    example: "Fill template with research data"
  },
  
  claude: {
    use: "Long-form analysis, cultural nuance",
    example: "Analyze blog posts → values alignment"
  },
  
  local: {
    use: "Caching, quick lookups, scoring",

4. **Data + Intuition** - Balance both
5. **Continuous optimization** - Always improving

### Encoded in System:
```javascript
const liatPattern = {
  research: "Minimum 3 sources",
  analysis: "Look for hidden patterns",
  messaging: "Genuine interest + value",
  timing: "Respect their schedule",
  followup: "Persistent but respectful",
  learning: "Every interaction teaches"
};
```
