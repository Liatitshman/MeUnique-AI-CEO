# 📊 מערכות ניטור ואופטימיזציה חכמות - Smart Monitoring & Optimization

## 🎯 Overview
Real-time monitoring isn't just about dashboards - it's about understanding what's happening NOW and predicting what will happen NEXT.

## 📊 שכבות הניטור - The Monitoring Stack

### 1️⃣ Activity Monitoring - "What's Happening Now"
```typescript
const activityTracking = {
  candidateActivity: {
    profileViews: {
      timestamp: Date.now(),
      duration: "seconds on page",
      sections: ["experience", "skills", "about"],
      depth: "scroll percentage"
    },
    linkedInActivity: {
      lastActive: "2 hours ago",
      posting: "daily|weekly|rarely",
      engagement: "likes, comments, shares",
      networkGrowth: "+50 connections/month"
    },
    emailBehavior: {

      replyTime: "same day|next day|week",
      deviceType: "mobile|desktop"
    }
  }
};
```
