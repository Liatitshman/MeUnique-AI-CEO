## 📁 Missing Files Note

You're right - the actual candidate files and interfaces are not under the folders yet. Here's what needs to be added:

### To Be Created:
1. `👑_CEO-System/📊_Dashboard/` - Actual dashboard components
2. `👑_CEO-System/🤖_Agents/[agent-name]/index.ts` - Agent implementations
3. `src/app/dashboard/` - Dashboard pages
4. `src/components/` - UI components

### Next Steps:
1. Create agent implementation files
2. Build dashboard UI
3. Connect to real APIs
4. Import historical data
